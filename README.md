# bookkeeperapp

The purpose of this project is to develop an app which allows users to upload and share data and encourages user interaction. The app is built using the flutter framework, and integrates the Google cloud platform Firebase. 

The Book Keeper app is a combination social media, book store, and e-reader application. Authors and readers can create accounts to share their reading and writing activity with their followers. Readers can also explore the book store, download books to read, and share book reviews. Admins maintain the app, create verified author accounts, and update the book store. The highlight of the app is the dynamic user experience between the three different types of users, and all the ways users are able to interact with the application, and one another.
